        A social material network
    </h1>

    <p >
        In a time where everyone shares everything it is now time to share our physical belongings as well. Thingsbook is about connecting our things in the same way as social networks today connects people. Thingsbook is meant to be an unprecedented social material network. Hopefully our planet will smile when material possesions are no longer kept hidden away from the benefits of online networks. Tag, share and like are now the new old things.

        Profiles instead of ads
    </h1>
        <p >Bring your possesions to life</p>
    <p >
         Instead of letting the information that is put into an ad for an item go to waste Thingsbook uses the information to create a thingsbook profile. This profile is like a persistent ad that follows an item when it is sold, bought or borrowed between different users. It also allows for manufacturers of things to take responsibility and track products after they have left the store. Have fun stalking your friends things!

        Tag things

        <p > Most of us have more things than friends</p>
    <p >
         Thingsbook lets you tag some of these possesions and share them with your friends or with people in your surroundings. You tag things in photos so that other people can see how your things look like. Since it is harder to exactly identify a thing than a person thingsbook uses tags to provide a generic way of describing a thing.

        Share things

    <p >Material sharing that really matters</p>
    <p >
        By clicking share you put your thing as a collective resource for your chosen Thingsbook community. Everyone in the network is identified by an external social network like for example facebook. Thingspooling is the new carpooling and selling or trading something you own will now be just one click away. Thingsbook will also make it possible for a group of friends or neighbours to buy something together in a Kickstarter kind of way.

     <p >Customer reviews on demand</p>
    <p >
        Instead of having to read random people's customer reviews you can now just see if anyone in your trusted network owns a certain thing and then ask them about it directy. In this way reviews will only be written when needed and only read by people who really trust the author.
